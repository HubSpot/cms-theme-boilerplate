## Purpose

The [HubSpot CMS Boilerplate](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/building-blocks/themes/hubspot-cms-boilerplate) is designed to offer developers a head start in the website building process. While the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate represents HubSpot's opinionated best practices, we intend to learn from similar projects and feedback. We hope it offers inspiration and utility for all website projects!

## Getting started

### To download the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate using the HubSpot CMS CLI:

Before getting started, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, the [HubSpot CMS CLI](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started-with-local-development#install-dependencies) installed, and we strongly suggest that you set up a [HubSpot CMS Developer Sandbox](https://offers.hubspot.com/free-cms-developer-sandbox) for your QA/testing environment.

1. Navigate to the directory that you want to use for your project
2. Run `hs create website-theme <directory>` to create a project from the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate
3. [Configure](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started-with-local-development#configure-the-local-development-tools) the local development tools for the portal(s) you'd like to use for your project.
4. Run `hs watch --portal=<portal> src <directory> --initial-upload` to upload all the files in the project and [watch for changes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cms-cli#watch) to files in the `src` directory

Please reference our _[Quick start guide to developing on the HubSpot CMS](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started)_ and our _[Getting started with local development](https://designers.hubspot.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-local-development)_ articles for more information.

### To use version control in your project using GitHub and GitHub Actions:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your computer
2. [Set up GitHub secrets in your forked repository to encrypt sensitive information from showing publically](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) for `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` and `HUBSPOT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEY`
3. Update the name of the directory that you'll be deploying to in your Design Manager in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file (the current default `dest_dir` is `cms-theme-boilerplate`)
4. Deploy changes to your Design Manager by pushing to the `main` branch of your forked repository

Please reference our [_HubSpot CMS deploy GitHub action page_](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hubspot-cms-deploy) and _[Setting up continuous integration with a GitHub repository using GitHub Actions article](https://designers.hubspot.com/tutorials/github-integration)_ for more information.
