## Local Module Development

Local [modules](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/modules/getting-started) are formatted in a series of files, within a `.module` directory, each specifying various components of a module. To learn more about the local module file format, and how to add fields and meta information to modules locally, refer to the [local module development documentation](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/local-module-development). When creating modules locally, you can scaffold out an entire module using the [create](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/local-development-reference#create) command.
