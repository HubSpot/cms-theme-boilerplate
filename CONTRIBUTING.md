## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/issues) is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, and making features requests but please be sure to follow the following guidelines:
* For questions specific to your individual project, and how to build something, reach out in the [community developer forums](https://community.hubspot.com/t5/HubSpot-Developers/ct-p/developers) or [HubSpot Developer Slack](https://designers.hubspot.com/slack).
* If you experience issues with your HubSpot account itself, such as features not working as expected, [reach out to HubSpot support](https://help.hubspot.com).
* Please be respectful and constructive with any and all feedback, we all want to build a better experience together.
* Please open issues for third party tools in their respective repositories (e.g. [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)).

## Reporting bugs

A bug is a reproducible issue that is caused by the code in the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate. If you find a bug while using the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate for your projects, please let us know! Any bugs that are not specifically related to the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate and are more related to the HubSpot product should be filed to our support team. More information on contacting our support team can be found [here](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account/get-help-with-hubspot).

Guidelines for a bug report:

* Search through [open GitHub issues](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/issues) to see if there is already an open issue.
* Check to see if the issue has been [fixed in a recent pull request](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and ensure that you’re using the latest version of the main branch when testing.
* Isolate the problem and create a list of reproducible steps.
* A good bug report should include all information needed for someone to resolve the issue. Please try to be as detailed as possible. Providing more detail will make it easier to identify the issue and resolve the issue faster.

## Feature requests

A feature request is a request for a new feature that currently doesn't exist within the project. While we welcome feature requests, please take some time to determine how the feature request fits into the existing project. We'll need to understand why the feature is important and what it is solving. Any feature requests that are not specifically related to the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate and are more related to the HubSpot product should be submitted to our ideas forum [here](https://community.hubspot.com/t5/Ideas/ct-p/ideas) or in the #ideas channel in our public [developer Slack channel](https://developers.hubspot.com/slack).

Guidelines for a feature request:

* Search through [open GitHub issues](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/issues) to see if there is already an open issue related to the feature request.
* Check to see if the feature request has been [implemented in a recent pull request](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and ensure that you’re using the latest version of the main branch when testing.

## Pull requests

Pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, and new features are great ways to help contribute to the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate. You can and should expect some back-and-forth with stakeholders when you open a pull request. Please check in frequently to address any requests for changes so that your code can successfully be merged.

Guidelines for pull requests:

* Changes made in pull requests should have a focused scope and you should avoid containing unrelated commits to the change that is being made.
* **Please reach out** before working on a significantly large pull request otherwise you may risk spending a lot of time on something that may not end up being merged into the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate. We’d recommend creating an issue using the label of `idea` prior to working on a large update to the project.
* Please ensure that your changes follow our [style guide requirements](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/STYLEGUIDE.md) to ensure that all code remains consistent and easy to read.

We recommend [forking the project](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) and submitting your changes using the [pull request template](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/tree/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE).
