Add the license for your theme here.

To add a license to your theme you can either use a valid SPDX identifier (https://spdx.org/licenses/) for the license property in your theme.json file or you can update this file with your license as the license property in theme.json is already using the relative path option to link to this license file. For more information on the license property please reference this article (https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes#theme-json).
